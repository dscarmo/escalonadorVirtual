This file describes how we should do this.

-We have a list of events ordered by RM priority. But the execution is the problem.

-We need an eventList, but also an Action list.
    Possible Actions: Receive Event, Release Event

-Every next Event execute next Action in the current Event and set next Event and Action. How? Pretty hard. Probably
